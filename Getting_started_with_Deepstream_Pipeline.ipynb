    "The nvinfer plugin provides [TensorRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html)-based inference for detection and tracking. The lowlevel library (libnvds_infer) operates either on float RGB or BGR planar data with dimensions of Network Height and Network Width. The plugin accepts NV12/RGBA data from upstream components like the decoder, muxer, and dewarper.\n",
    "The Gst-nvinfer plugin also performs preprocessing operations like format conversion, scaling, mean subtraction, and produces final float RGB/BGR planar data which is passed to the low-level library. The low-level library uses the TensorRT engine for inferencing. It outputs each classified object’s class and each detected object’s bounding boxes (Bboxes) after clustering.\n",

    "The nvosd plugin draws bounding boxes, text, and RoI (Regions of Interest) polygons (Polygons are presented as a set of lines). The plugin accepts an RGBA buffer with attached metadata from the upstream component. It\n",
    "draws bounding boxes, which may be shaded depending on the configuration (e.g. width, color, and opacity) of a given bounding box. It also draws text and RoI polygons at specified locations in the frame. Text and polygon parameters are configurable through metadata.\n",
